**myFlix Client**

**Project Objectives:**
To build the client-side component of a "movies" web application based on the existing server-side database. The web application will allow users to access information about different movies, directors and genres. Users will be able to log in, register, de-register, update their personal information and also create a list of their favorite movies securely.
